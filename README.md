# Geo Coordinate Validator

This Python script is designed to validate geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) stored in a CSV or Excel file and save the results in a new CSV file. It uses the Geopy library to reverse geocode the coordinates and determine their validity.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas geopy
```

## Usage

1. Execute the script by running the `main()` function.
2. A file dialog will open, allowing you to select a CSV or Excel file that contains geographic coordinates.
3. The script will validate the coordinates and create a new CSV file with a "Validation Status" column that indicates whether each coordinate is valid or not.

## Code Explanation

### Libraries Used
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `geopy` for geocoding operations.
- `tkinter` for the file dialog.
- `datetime` for generating timestamps.
- `os` for file and folder handling.

### Functions

- `batch_geocode(coordinates)`: This function takes a list of coordinates and validates them using the Nominatim geocoder. It returns a list of validation results (Valid/Invalid) corresponding to the input coordinates.

- `validate_coordinates(df)`: This function takes a DataFrame containing 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' columns, validates the coordinates, and adds a 'Validation Status' column to the DataFrame.

- `main()`: The main function initializes a tkinter GUI, opens a file dialog for selecting the input file, validates the coordinates, and saves the results to a new CSV file with a timestamp. It also handles unsupported file formats.

## Output

The validated coordinates are saved in a CSV file in an "output" folder with a filename containing the timestamp of the validation. The file will look like this:

```
Latitude  Longitude  Validation Status
40.7128   -74.0060   Valid
34.0522   -118.2437  Valid
37.7749   -122.4194  Valid
48.8566   2.3522     Valid
...
```

## Supported File Formats

The script supports CSV and Excel (XLSX) file formats. If you try to open an unsupported file format, the script will display an error message and exit.

## Example

Here's how to run the script:

1. Save the script to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `geo_coordinate_validator.py`).
2. Open a command prompt or terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script by executing the command:

```bash
python geo_coordinate_validator.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to select an input file and view the results in the "output" folder.

Feel free to use this script to validate geographic coordinates in your data.
